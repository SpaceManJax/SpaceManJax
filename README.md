Hi, I'm StarFallenJax.. but since we're such closest and dearest friends, you can just call me Jax. I'm a novice modder and coder that likes to make random projects — and mostly fail — but when they do work, it's always amazing! 

Currently, I'm working on my new Enter the Gungeon mod, B.U.R.G.E.R., which you can find in my repositories.
